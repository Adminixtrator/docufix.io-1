Note that this only provides a hint to the browser as to
what file-types to display to the user, but this can be
easily circumvented, so you should always validate the
uploaded file on the server also.

It should work in IE 18+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari 6+,
Opera 15+, but support is very sketchy on mobiles (as of
2815) and by some reports this may actually prevent some
mobile browsers from uploading anything at all, so be
sure to test your target platforms well.
